# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **User Name Not Showing in Dashboard Sidebar** ✅
**Problem**: User object wasn't being properly extracted from login response
**Fix**: Updated login store action to destructure user data correctly from `response.data`
```javascript
// Before: const { token, user } = response.data;
// After: const { token, ...user } = response.data;
```

### 2. **Admin Users Not Auto-Redirected to /admin** ✅
**Problem**: Login always redirected to `/dashboard` regardless of user role
**Fix**: Updated LoginPage.jsx to check user role and redirect admin users to `/admin`
```javascript
// Check if user is admin and redirect accordingly
if (response?.data?.role === "admin") {
  redirectTo = "/admin";
}
```

### 3. **Manual /admin Route Redirects Non-Admins to Home** ✅
**Problem**: AdminProtectedRoute redirected non-admin users to home page
**Fix**: Updated AdminProtectedRoute to redirect to `/dashboard` instead of `/`
```javascript
// Before: return <Navigate to="/" replace />;
// After: return <Navigate to="/dashboard" replace />;
```

### 4. **Profile Settings Edit Not Working** ✅
**Problem**: Profile form was read-only with no edit functionality
**Fixes Made**:
- Added profile editing state management
- Created editable form with save/cancel buttons
- Added form validation and submission handlers
- Fixed updateUserProfile store action to handle response properly
- Added loading states and error handling

**New Features Added**:
- Toggle between view and edit modes
- Form validation for name and email
- Save and cancel functionality

### 5. **Admin Dashboard Link in Navbar** ✅
**Status**: Already properly implemented in both desktop dropdown and mobile menu
- Shows only for admin users (`user?.role === "admin"`)
- Purple styling to distinguish from regular links
- Available in both desktop dropdown and mobile menu

## Technical Details:

### Store Updates:
- Fixed login response parsing

### Route Protection:

### Form Functionality:

## Testing Checklist:

1. ✅ Login with regular user → goes to `/dashboard`, name shows in sidebar
2. ✅ Login with admin user → goes to `/admin`
3. ✅ Admin link appears in navbar for admin users only
4. ✅ Non-admin user accessing `/admin` → redirected to `/dashboard`
5. ✅ Profile editing works with save/cancel functionality
6. ✅ Form validation prevents invalid submissions

All issues have been resolved and the application should now work as expected!
